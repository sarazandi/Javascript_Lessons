Javascript Lessons
==================

A series of forkable exercises for learning both JavaScript and Git.

Navigate into each *LEVEL* and complete the steps. 

*Note: Each task should take no longer than 1 hour at the most.*



### Prerequisites

- Please note that this will require some basic [JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) and [Git] (https://help.github.com/) knowledge, but the exercises are designed to **grow** that knowledge, so don't feel dumb if you don't know how to do things immediately! Remember, Google is your friend!

- You will need to have [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-all) and the GitHub App for [OSX](https://mac.github.com/) or [Win](https://windows.github.com/) installed. If you are having problems, please message me directly (or [open an issue] (https://github.com/JesseScott/Javascript_Lessons/issues) for bonus points!).



## Tasks

1. Fork this repository 
	- Look for the icon in the top right corner that looks like a tuning fork, or a branch in the road
	- Feel free to read [this article] (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for a review

2. Choosing a *LEVEL* at a time, navigate into a subdirectory.
	- Each subdirectory will have several HTML (and possibly CSS/JS) files, as well as an **INSTRUCTIONS** file
	- The **INSTRUCTIONS** file will explain the task for each exercise in the *LEVEL*
	- Make the edits to the *existing files* as they are laid out (just for my ease of reviewing quickly)

4. Commit and Push your code 
	- This will show up under your repository 
	- Commit upon the successful completion on each task in the README

5. Send a Pull Request
	- The Pull Request option should exist on the menu items in the right hand side of the page
	- Feel free to read [this article] (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for a review
	- Once you have forked the code, I will create a *branch of my code* with *your name* on it 
	- Create the Pull Request from *your master branch* of *your forked repository* to the *branch with your name on it* of *my repository* 

6. Feedback
	- I will review the Pull Request and accept or deny it, pending the code
	- I will open issues and tag you with feedback as necessary

7. Profit
